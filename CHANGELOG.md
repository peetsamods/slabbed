## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0-beta.4] — Audited Release Candidate

### Release status
- BLOCKED locally after unreleased real-game testing: live targeting/outline still mismatches in compact lowered stone/slab stacks while holding a stone slab. Do not upload or mark ready until a RED proof, fix, and re-audit pass.

### Notes
- Prepared from the audited Phase19 integration savepoint with no gameplay logic changes.
- Release metadata only; public jar contents remained clean in the beta-readiness audit.

## [0.2.0-beta.2] — Side-Slab Torch Stability

### Fixed
- Fixed adjacent side slabs beside lowered slab-supported full blocks so they remain visually lowered.
- Fixed repeat-click / double-slab behavior on adjacent lowered side slabs.
- Fixed floor torch placement, selection, and flame particle behavior on BS-FB-0.5S setups.
- Fixed wall torch flame particles floating above lowered torch visuals.
- Removed forced ghost wireframe debug boxes from normal runClient.
- Corrected a stale server proof so ordinary full blocks lowering onto slabs is protected as intended behavior.

### Improved
- Added proof coverage for adjacent side-slab dy inheritance.
- Added proof coverage for floor torch compound dy and selectable comfort.
- Preserved known no-rescue boundaries for chain and crafting table.
- Enforced release artifact purity by excluding dev/debug tooling from the public jar.

### Known note
- Floor torch selection on BS-FB-0.5S may reach slightly downward into the supporting slab area; accepted because breaking that support would break the torch anyway.

## [0.2.0-beta.1-hotfix.1]
### Fixed
- Restored stable selection outline/hitbox behavior for slab-supported functional blocks.
- Removed experimental/debug instrumentation (no [SHAPES]/[RAYCAST_EMPTY]/DIAG_FALLBACK/CrosshairTargetRedirectMixin/RaycastShapeDebugMixin on this hotfix line).

### Known issues
- Ghosting in complex slab+block stacking remains; not addressed in this hotfix.

## [0.1.1-alpha]
### Added / Changed
- Sodium-compatible rendering: FRAPI quad vertex translation so block models visually align with slab top surfaces (no Indigo/Indium required).
- Generic model wrapping approach: slab Y-offset determined at render time via SlabSupport single-source-of-truth.

### Fixed
- Torch + common block model visual alignment on slab tops under Sodium.

### Known issues
- Redstone on slabs: visual/connection edge cases remain (down-step and power propagation still under investigation).
- Hanging support under top slabs: needs explicit in-game verification/triage for any remaining blocks beyond lanterns.
