# Slabbed — agent guide

Rules for ANY coding agent working in this repo (Claude, Codex, or otherwise). AGENTS.md is an
identical copy for tools that read that name; edit both together.

## The two laws

1. **LAW 1 — placement is permanent.** Read `LAW.md` before touching anything in the placement or
   height-resolution path. `LAW.md` is supreme; no other doc may redefine it. Its enforcement is
   `NeighborUpdateInvarianceTest` (the S-2 gate), which is **blocking by default** — a violation
   fails the build. `-Dslabbed.lawGate=false` downgrades to a printed inventory and is only for
   fixing a deliberate new RED forward, never for landing one.

2. **The discretion law (maintainer ruling, 2026-08-07) — this repo is public and stays
   impersonal.** No personal names, no machine-local usernames or absolute home-directory paths,
   no session/recorder identifiers, and no development-diary narrative in ANY tracked file —
   source comments included. Cite decisions as "maintainer ruling, \<date\>". The commit hook's
   S-6 gate rejects violations mechanically. Development narrative (handoffs, live-test ledgers,
   incident logs) lives OUTSIDE the repo in the maintainer's local notes directory
   (`Slabbed-notes/` beside the worktree roots; the hook's S-5 gate knows the path). Do not
   create new process docs in the repo — write them to the notes directory.

## Comments document invariants, not history

A comment states what must stay true and, at most, one dated ruling-of-record pointer. Session
play-by-play, quotes, coordinates, and run ids belong in the local notes ledger and git history.
Keep the "do not re-add X" guard comments — they are anti-regression tripwires.

## Verification is not optional

- `./gradlew25 build runGameTest` on a CLEAN run dir (`rm -rf build/run/gameTest` first — a stale
  dir silently drops tests and still prints green). This line needs JDK 25; plain `./gradlew` on a
  JDK 21 default fails to read the MC named jar.
- The reported count MUST match `python3 tools/expected-gametest-count.py`. A green with the
  wrong count is a false green.
- Keep the literal `@GameTest` token out of comments in registered test classes as hygiene, but the
  count script strips comments before counting and no longer depends on it. (It once did: five
  `{@code @GameTest}` javadoc mentions inflated the expected total to 575 against a true 570, so the
  gate reported a permanent false mismatch — fixed 2026-08-20.)
- The count covers the `fabric-gametest` entrypoint only. Classes under `fabric-client-gametest`
  are **not** counted by any gate.
- The release jar is gated by a closed-world allowlist (`RELEASE_ALLOWLIST.md`) checked during
  `build`; debug/dev tooling ships in every jar default-off, but the file-writing audit/recorder
  packages never ship.

## Commit hygiene

`git config core.hooksPath tools/hooks` once per checkout. Gates: S-1 (any tracked doc using law
vocabulary must reference LAW.md), S-4 (`LAW-PREFLIGHT: n|y` trailer on `src/main` commits), S-5
(behavior commits require a fresh entry in the local out-of-repo ledger), S-6 (discretion — see
above). S-3 (a keyword regex) was retired 2026-08-07; do not reintroduce it.
